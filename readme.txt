Problem statement:

Ocean pollution is very serious in Australia, especially in the densely populated state of Victoria. As the population increases, water pollution
inevitably increases. There are many sources of water pollution. Humans dumping domestic garbage into rivers, lakes, and the sea will pollute water
resources. Some factories will also remove chemical waste into the water, or problems such as oil spills. This is part of the data we provide. Water
pollution affects aquatic organisms and even more affects people's life and health. Garbage in the water will degrade and destroy the habitat needed
by plants and animals. Human health is also at risk, because the plastic may break down into smaller pieces, which may eventually enter our food.


Solution:

The purpose of our team is to build an environment-friendly website on the protection of water resources. This website can provide a platform for people
to freely report people's pollution behavior, such as dumping garbage into the ocean and factory exhaust. We will work hard to get the support of the 
Victorian government for this website. Therefore, people's actions that damage the environment will be punished. Furthermore, we will also organize some
volunteer activities on this website, and all environmentalists can voluntarily sign up to be responsible for supervising the governance of water resources.


Purpose:

Our project will be building a webpage where the user can report instances of ocean pollution and see the locations where the Pollutants were found 
in past, and also create awareness to reduce the cause of ocean pollution.


Features(iteration1):

Homepage - briefly introduce the current situation of ocean pollution
Activity - organise some volunteer activities to clean the beaches garbage
Tips - provide some travelling tools and some cleaning tools when participating in the activities


Tech Used:

Wordpress - use wordpress to build up a website so that users can know about more information of ocean pollution via our website 
	Plugin:
	WP clone - used to migrate the project
	VersionPress - used to record the production process
	Elementor - used to edit web pages
	Portfolio Gallery - used to make a gallery
	Wp file manager - used to download and manage projects
	Master Slider - used to make Gallery
	
Rstudio - The data wrangling process has been implemented using rstudio which involves the following steps
	Steps followed:
		- Cleaned the dataset, checking and removal of the missing values and dropped the columns which were not required for our analysis
		- Merged the dataset with the Australian postcode data and calculated haversine distance for each data points to each suburb in Australia
		- Checked for the minimum distance for each datapoints and assigned the state associated with those suburbs 
		- Converted the orientation and format of the data as per the required format for visualisation
	Library used – dplyr

Tableau - We used tableau to visualise the data from the final cleaned dataset which we got after the data wrangling process in r studio. We had created two visualisations in tableau which are as follow
	Steps followed:
		- Plot 1 - A grouped bar plot showcasing the concentration of different pollutant types in the waters around Australia in state level.
		- Plot 2 - A pie plot showcasing the sea surface plastic concentrations (Cs, pieces/km2) for different states of Australia.

RShiny dashboard - Shiny dashboard has been used to create the plastic footprint calculator which is present in the calculator tab of the webpage.
	Steps followed:
		- We placed all the input fields in the sidebar of the dashboard and used numeriInput() to take the inputs in the ui part 
		- And then in the main panel we rendered two gauge plots using plotlyOutput() where one plot showcases the amount of plastic generated in kilos by the user in a year and the second plot showcases the amount of plastic generated by the user in kilos in lifetime.
		- We have also rendered one infoboxOutput() in the main panel which showcases the comment related to the output.
		- Then in the server part we have calculated the kilo per year value based on the count input provided by the user for each field. For this we have taken average weight of each item.
		- And lastly in the server part wrote the logic for the plots and the infobox using renderPlotly() and renderInfoBox().
	Library used – shiny, shinyBS, shinydashboard, shinycssloader, plotly, tidyverse, DT, shinyWidget, data.table, fmsb, dplyr, flexdashboard, shinythemes 


Languages:

Javascript - use javascript plug-ins and some logic codes to present some logic on the web side
CSS - create the effects presented by each component in the web page, such as color, text style, button hover, etc
HTML - build web frames such as div, p, a, h1, and so on

Future Features:

Iteration2 - 
Facts - provide some information of pollution condition in all states
Calculator - calculate the sum of plastic garbage produced by each person yearly

Iteration3 - 
Quiz - Provide some questions related to marine pollution, allowing users to learn about marine pollution by answering the questions.
Game - Provide a game of Garbage classification so that users can learn some Garbage classification knowledge through play the game.
Flashcard - Provide descriptions of some marine pollution terms, allowing users to learn these vocabulary in the process of guessing.
