Problem statement:

Ocean pollution is very serious in Australia, especially in the densely populated state of Victoria. As the population increases, water pollution
inevitably increases. There are many sources of water pollution. Humans dumping domestic garbage into rivers, lakes, and the sea will pollute water
resources. Some factories will also remove chemical waste into the water, or problems such as oil spills. This is part of the data we provide. Water
pollution affects aquatic organisms and even more affects people's life and health. Garbage in the water will degrade and destroy the habitat needed
by plants and animals. Human health is also at risk, because the plastic may break down into smaller pieces, which may eventually enter our food.


Solution:

The purpose of our team is to build an environment-friendly website on the protection of water resources. This website can provide a platform for people
to freely report people's pollution behavior, such as dumping garbage into the ocean and factory exhaust. We will work hard to get the support of the 
Victorian government for this website. Therefore, people's actions that damage the environment will be punished. Furthermore, we will also organize some
volunteer activities on this website, and all environmentalists can voluntarily sign up to be responsible for supervising the governance of water resources.


Purpose:

Our project will be building a webpage where the user can report instances of ocean pollution and see the locations where the Pollutants were found 
in past, and also create awareness to reduce the cause of ocean pollution.


Features:

Homepage - briefly introduce the current situation of ocean pollution
Facts - provide some information of pollution condition in all states
Calculator - calculate the sum of plastic garbage produced by each person yearly
Activity - organise some volunteer activities to clean the beaches garbage
Tips - provide some travelling tools and some cleaning tools when participating in the activities
